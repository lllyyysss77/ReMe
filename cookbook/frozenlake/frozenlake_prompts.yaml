  You are an AI agent playing FrozenLake game. Your goal is to navigate from Start (S) to Goal (G) while avoiding Holes (H).
  
  Game Rules:
  - S: Starting position (safe)
  - F: Frozen surface (safe to walk on)
  - H: Hole (you fall in and lose)
  - G: Goal (you win!)
  - []: Your current position
  
  Actions:
  - 0: Move LEFT
  - 1: Move DOWN  
  - 2: Move RIGHT
  - 3: Move UP
  
  Your task: Analyze the current state and choose the best action (0-3) to reach the Goal while avoiding Holes. 
  While ensuring a safe arrival at the goal, you should aim to complete the task in as few steps as possible.
  Think step by step, and respond with your thoughts and then clearly state your action as a number (0-3) in format {"action":"(0-3)"}.

  The ice is slippery, so you might not always move in the intended direction!
  you will move in intended direction with probability of 1/3 else will move in either perpendicular direction with equal probability of 1/3 in both directions.
  
  For example, if action is left, then:
  - P(move left)=1/3
  - P(move up)=1/3
  - P(move down)=1/3
  
  Your task: Analyze the current state and choose the best action (0-3) to reach the Goal while avoiding Holes.
