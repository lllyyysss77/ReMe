  <strong>A local-first, self-evolving personal knowledge base for AI agents.</strong><br>
</p>

> Previous versions: [0.3.x](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe/tree/reme_v3) ·

> [MemoryScope](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe/tree/memoryscope_branch)

🧠 ReMe turns conversations and resources into readable, editable, searchable, and interconnected Markdown memory. It
works alongside agents such as QwenPaw, OpenClaw, Hermes, and Claude Code, continuously organizing what they learn while
keeping the files under the user's control.

## ✨ Core Ideas

- **Memory as File, File as Memory**: Markdown files with frontmatter and wikilinks serve as memory nodes that both
  users and agents can inspect, edit, move, and back up directly.
- **Self-evolving knowledge base**: Auto Memory, Auto Resource, and Auto Dream progressively transform conversations and
  resources into daily notes and long-term knowledge, while Auto Link writes relationships and sources back into the
  files.
- **Progressive hybrid search**: ReMe combines wikilinks, BM25, and embeddings for hybrid retrieval across keyword
  matching, optional semantic recall, and relationship expansion without loading every neighboring file into context.
- **Agent-friendly integration**: SKILL.md + CLI integration makes it easy for different agents to read, write,
  maintain, and reuse the same local workspace. HTTP, MCP, and Python integrations are also available.

## 🔭 Use Cases

- **Personal assistants**: Give personal assistants such as
  [QwenPaw](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw), [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), and
  [Hermes](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent) a user-editable long-term memory layer.
- **Coding agents**: Preserve coding style, project background, repository decisions, and workflow experience across
  sessions when integrating with coding agents such as [Claude Code](plugins/claude_code/reme).
- **LLM Wiki**: Turn conversations, notes, and resources into a searchable, traceable, and linked Markdown knowledge
  base that both users and agents can maintain.
- **Self-evolving agents**: Support agents that learn from experience by saving successful paths, failed attempts,
  reusable procedures, and periodic reflections as memory.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

ReMe requires Python 3.11+.

Install from pip:

```bash
pip install "reme-ai[core]"
```

Install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe.git
cd ReMe
pip install -e ".[core]"
```

### Environment Variables

Configure environment variables when you want LLM-powered memory evolution or embedding retrieval. Embeddings are
disabled by default, so the default setup does not start an embedding model or require an embedding API key.

```bash
cat > .env <<'EOF'
# Optional: used only after embedding components are explicitly enabled in the config.
# EMBEDDING_API_KEY=sk-xxx
# EMBEDDING_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1

# Required for auto_memory, auto_resource, and auto_dream.
LLM_API_KEY=sk-xxx
LLM_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
EOF
```

Basic file operations, BM25 search, wikilink traversal, and reading proactive topics can run without LLM credentials.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable embedding-based semantic retrieval, uncomment `components.as_embedding` and
> `components.embedding_store` in [`reme/config/default.yaml`](reme/config/default.yaml), then change
> `components.file_store.default.embedding_store` from `""` to `default`. See the
> [memory search guide](docs/en/memory_search.md) for details.

### Start the Service

```bash
reme start
```

The default service address is `127.0.0.1:2333`. If the port is occupied, specify another port:

```bash
reme start service.port=8181
# reme start workspace_dir=/tmp/reme-demo service.port=8181
```

After startup, check the service status. If you use a custom port, replace `2333` in the URL below with that port.

When the web build is available, the HTTP service also serves **ReMe Studio** at <http://127.0.0.1:2333/>. Studio can
browse, edit, and search the workspace, chat with the read-only workspace agent, and inspect the digest wikilink graph.
Set `service.web_enabled=false` to disable it, or use `service.web_static_dir` / `REME_WEB_STATIC_DIR` to provide a
custom static build. The Job API remains available when no web build is found.

```bash
reme version
reme health_check
reme help
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:2333/version -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

### Use ReMe Studio

Open <http://127.0.0.1:2333/> after starting the default HTTP service. Studio provides:

- **Files, Daily, and Knowledge views** for navigating the whole workspace or focusing on `daily/` and `digest/`.
- **Markdown tabs** with preview, split editing, optimistic save checks, and local download.
- **Memory Graph** for exploring indexed `personal`, `procedure`, and `wiki` nodes and opening their Markdown sources.
- **Read-only Agent chat** with streamed tool activity and usage; drag a workspace file into the composer to reference it.
- **Settings** for service/component status, redacted effective configuration, version information, and safe index rebuilding.
- English/Chinese language switching and light, dark, or system appearance.

For frontend development, run ReMe and Studio in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1, repository root
reme start

# Terminal 2
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>. The development server uses `http://127.0.0.1:2333` by default; set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_REME_API_URL` to connect to another ReMe HTTP service. Static-build and frontend configuration instructions are
in the [ReMe Studio guide](https://reme.agentscope.io/?doc=studio-en).

### 5-Minute Memory Demo

With the service running, write a memory node, let ReMe index it, then retrieve it:

```bash
reme write \
  path=digest/wiki/quick-start-demo \
  name="Quick Start Demo" \
  description="A first ReMe memory node" \
  content="# Quick Start Demo

ReMe stores agent memory as readable Markdown.

Related: [[digest/wiki/memory-as-file.md]]"

reme search query="agent memory markdown" limit=5
reme read path=digest/wiki/quick-start-demo start_line=1 end_line=20
```

The generated file is ordinary Markdown with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: Quick Start Demo
description: A first ReMe memory node
---

# Quick Start Demo

ReMe stores agent memory as readable Markdown.

## 📁 Memory System

> Memory as File, File as Memory.

ReMe treats **memory as files**, progressively processing filtered conversation source records and external resources
from `session/` and `resource/` into `daily/`, then consolidating them into reusable long-term memory nodes under
`digest/`. The default workspace is `.reme/` under the current directory; `workspace_dir=...` selects a different
user-owned location.

## 🧭 Memory Design Philosophy

> Capture conversation source records and resources, refine them into long-term preferences, reusable experience, and
> valuable knowledge,
> while keeping the result editable by humans and agents.

### Automatic Memory Flow

ReMe follows a capture → index → consolidate → recall loop. Conversations and resources first become daily memory cards;
background jobs keep files searchable; `auto_dream` distills stable knowledge into `digest/`; agents recall memory
through search, wikilinks, or proactive topics. The files are the durable source of truth—indexes, graphs, catalogs, and
caches under `metadata/` can be rebuilt from them.

| Capability                                  | Entry point                                     | What it does                                                                                                                                                   | Output                                                        |

Search returns the best matching chunks with file paths and line ranges, then lists bounded incoming and outgoing
wikilink neighbors by metadata. An agent can read a promising source or traverse the graph only when needed. With
embeddings enabled, BM25 and vector rankings are fused with reciprocal rank fusion (RRF); otherwise the default remains
BM25 plus wikilink expansion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `proactive` only reads and exposes interest topics produced by Auto Dream. It does not independently browse the web,
> send notifications, or rewrite the knowledge base; the host agent decides whether and how to act on a topic.

## 📊 Performance

ReMe evaluates multi-session and long-context memory with agentic search-and-read workflows. The figures below are the
published reference runs in this repository; model, prompt, dataset, and judging details are documented with each
benchmark.

| Benchmark                                                    | Setting      |              Sample size | Agentic score | Focus                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------:|--------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

ReMe also achieved a **0.580 PROC score across five user personas** in the repository's
[π-Bench evaluation](https://reme.agentscope.io/?doc=pibench-en), 2.4% above NanoBot under the same test-model configuration. PROC
measures proactive handling of hidden intent, clarification, cross-session preferences and conventions, task
dependencies, and underspecified requests.

## 🤝 Agent-friendly Integration

ReMe can run as a local memory service accessed through the CLI, HTTP API, or MCP server, or it can be embedded in the
host process through its Python API. The default HTTP service can serve ReMe Studio at the same address. Agents can
choose the path that fits their runtime and share a local memory workspace when appropriate.

| Agents                                        | Recommended path                                                                                        | Available after integration                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **QwenPaw**                                   | Embed ReMe in-process through its Python API.                                                           | Reuse the host application's lifecycle and model config while keeping memory local and file-based.      |
| **Claude Code**                               | Start the streamable HTTP MCP service and install [plugins/claude_code/reme](plugins/claude_code/reme). | MCP recall tools, a `reme-memory` skill, and a Stop hook that records sessions automatically.           |
| **Hermes**                                    | Start the HTTP service and install [plugins/hermes_agent](plugins/hermes_agent).                        | Recall relevant memory before model calls and enqueue `auto_memory` after each completed turn.          |
| **Other CLI-capable agents (OpenClaw/Codex)** | Copy or install [skills/reme_memory/SKILL.md](skills/reme_memory/SKILL.md).                             | Search, read, and write memory via the CLI; automatic recording requires explicit host lifecycle hooks. |

## 🛠️ ReMe Operations

ReMe operates the workspace through a unified job interface exposed by the CLI. Agents usually only need retrieval,
reading, writing, editing, and automatic memory commands. Lower-level indexing, frontmatter, and file operation commands
are mainly for maintenance, debugging, or advanced integration. Run `reme help` for the full job list.

| Command                                   | Purpose                                                                                |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
