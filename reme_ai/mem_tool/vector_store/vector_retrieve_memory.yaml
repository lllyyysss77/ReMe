tool: |
  Retrieve memories from the memory store using vector similarity search.
  Use this tool to find relevant memories based on semantic similarity to the query.
  The search returns the most relevant memories ranked by similarity score.

  Note: Within the same session, this tool automatically deduplicates results across multiple calls.
  If you call this tool multiple times, only new memories (not previously retrieved) will be returned.
  This prevents redundant information in subsequent retrievals.

tool_multiple: |
  Retrieve memories from the memory store using multiple queries with vector similarity search.
  Use this tool to find relevant memories based on semantic similarity to multiple queries.
  This is useful when you need to search for different types of information in a single operation.
  The search returns the most relevant memories ranked by similarity score for each query.

  Note: Within the same session, this tool automatically deduplicates results across multiple calls.
  If you call this tool multiple times, only new memories (not previously retrieved) will be returned.
  This prevents redundant information in subsequent retrievals.

memory_type: |
  The type of memory to search for. Must be one of:
  - "identity": Information about the AI agent's identity, role, or characteristics
  - "personal": Information about users, their preferences, or personal details

memory_target: |
  The target of the memory to search within.
  - For "personal" memory: the person's name or identifier (e.g., "john", "alice")
  - For "procedural" memory: the process or task name (e.g., "deployment", "authentication")

query: |
  The query text for vector similarity search.
  Use descriptive queries that capture the semantic meaning of what you're looking for.

query_items: |
  A list of query items for vector similarity search.
  Each item can include metadata_filters to narrow down search results.
