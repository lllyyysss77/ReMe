tool_multiple: |
  Retrieve memories using both time-based and multiple vector similarity searches.
  
  This tool combines two retrieval strategies:
  1. First retrieves the most recent memories based on modification time (recent top {recent_top_k})
  2. Then retrieves semantically similar memories for each of your queries (similar top {similar_top_k} per query)
  
  This is useful when you need to search for different types of information in a single operation,
  while also considering recent context.
  
  The results are automatically deduplicated, so you get a combined set of both recent
  and relevant memories without duplicates.
  
  Note: Within the same session, this tool automatically deduplicates results across multiple calls.
  If you call this tool multiple times, only new memories (not previously retrieved) will be returned.
  This prevents redundant information in subsequent retrievals.

query: |
  The query text for vector similarity search.
  Use descriptive queries that capture the semantic meaning of what you're looking for.

query_items: |
  A list of query items for vector similarity search.
  Each query will be used to find semantically similar memories, which will be combined
  with the recent memories retrieved based on modification time.
