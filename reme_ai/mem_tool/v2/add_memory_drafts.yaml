tool_multiple: |
  Create draft memories for initial recording of information.
  Use this tool to quickly capture information as drafts that can be reviewed or modified later.
  **CRITICAL**: Only add memories based on explicitly stated facts. DO NOT store inferred, assumed, or fabricated information.

memory_drafts: |
  A list of draft memory objects to create.
  Each draft represents a piece of information to be recorded initially.

when_to_use: |
  When to retrieve this memory.
  This field is used for vector embedding to improve retrieval accuracy by providing contextual information.

memory_content: |
  The content of the memory draft to record.
  Should be a clear, concise statement that captures the information to remember.
  Keep it focused on a single piece of information for better retrieval accuracy.
  **Must be strictly accurate and based only on explicitly stated facts - no inference or fabrication.**
