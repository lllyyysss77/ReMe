ReMe provides AI agents with a unified memory systemâ€”enabling the ability to extract, reuse, and share memories across
users, tasks, and agents.

```
Personal Memory + Task Memory + Tool Memory = Agent Memory
```

Personal memory helps "**understand user preferences**", task memory helps agents "**perform better**", and tool memory enables "**smarter tool usage**".

## Architecture Design

<p align="center">
 <img src="_static/figure/reme_structure.jpg" alt="ReMe Logo" width="100%">
</p>

ReMe integrates three complementary memory capabilities:

:::{admonition} Task Memory/Experience
:class: note

Procedural knowledge reused across agents

- **Success Pattern Recognition**: Identify effective strategies and understand their underlying principles
- **Failure Analysis Learning**: Learn from mistakes and avoid repeating the same issues
- **Comparative Patterns**: Different sampling trajectories provide more valuable memories through comparison
- **Validation Patterns**: Confirm the effectiveness of extracted memories through validation modules

:::{admonition} Personal Memory
:class: note

Contextualized memory for specific users

- **Individual Preferences**: User habits, preferences, and interaction styles
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Intelligent memory management based on time and context
- **Progressive Learning**: Gradually build deep understanding through long-term interaction
- **Time Awareness**: Time sensitivity in both retrieval and integration

:::{admonition} Tool Memory
:class: note

Data-driven tool selection and usage optimization

- **Historical Performance Tracking**: Success rates, execution times, and token costs from real usage
- **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation**: Qualitative insights on why tools succeed or fail
- **Parameter Optimization**: Learn optimal parameter configurations from successful calls
- **Dynamic Guidelines**: Transform static tool descriptions into living, learned manuals

## ðŸ“¦ Ready-to-Use Memories

ReMe provides pre-built memories that agents can immediately use with verified best practices:

### Available Memories

- **`appworld.jsonl`**: Memory library for Appworld agent interactions, covering complex task planning and execution
  patterns
- **`bfcl_v3.jsonl`**: Working memory library for BFCL tool calls

### Quick Usage

```{code-cell}
# Load pre-built memories
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8002/vector_store", json={
    "workspace_id": "appworld",
    "action": "load",
    "path": "./docs/library/"
})

# Query relevant memories
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8002/retrieve_task_memory", json={
    "workspace_id": "appworld",
    "query": "How to navigate to settings and update user profile?",
    "top_k": 1
})
```
