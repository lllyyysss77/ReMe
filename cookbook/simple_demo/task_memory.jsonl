This structured breakdown ensured comprehensive coverage of key domains without redundancy. Each search used precise, domain-specific keywords that yielded high-quality, actionable results. The agent then synthesized these into a coherent, layered analysis by prioritizing factual accuracy, chronological flow, and thematic grouping (e.g., separating history from business model).

This iterative approach allowed it to gather granular, up-to-date data (e.g., 2024 revenue, FSD V12 rollout, 16B km driving data) that would have been missed with a single broad query. By calling the same tool (web_search) multiple times with different parameters, the agent achieved triangulation across perspectives—ensuring completeness and reducing bias.
