# üó∫Ô∏è ExperienceMaker Future Roadmap

## P0 - Ready-to-Use Experience Libraries

We aim to build curated experience libraries for complex scenarios, providing battle-tested best practices and lessons learned rather than simple documentation aggregation.

Just as financial analysts develop analytical frameworks, senior engineers establish coding standards, and education experts create teaching methodologies, AI agents can build professional experience repositories. Start your AI projects standing on the shoulders of giants.

**Core Features:**
- [ ] Pre-built experience libraries for key domains (finance, programming, education, research, etc.)
- [ ] Experience marketplace: community-driven experience sharing and exchange

## P0 - Support for Rich Experience Formats

Expert knowledge extends beyond text to include debugged code, fine-tuned toolchains, and validated workflows. We aim to integrate diverse experience carriers:

- [ ] **Executable Code**: Functions, code files, and scripts
- [ ] **Tool Integration**: APIs, MCP configurations, and tool setups
- [ ] **Pipeline Templates**: Agent execution pipelines and multi-step tool combinations

## P1 - Experience Validation & Optimization

AI-powered analysis of experience usage patterns and effectiveness, with automatic quality optimization and cross-task validation feedback loops.

## P2 - Universal Trajectory Experience Extraction

### Raw Data Processing
- [ ] Automatic extraction of valuable experiences from agent execution logs
- [ ] Multimodal support: images, videos, and other formats

### Vision
Transform valuable experience data from daily work into usable insights:
- Communication techniques from emails
- Optimization insights from code commits
- Decision-making processes from meeting recordings

Enable AI to naturally become stronger through everyday work, rather than wasting real-world experience data due to format limitations.
