tool_multiple: |
  Update memories by removing outdated ones and adding new ones in a single atomic operation.
  Use this tool when you need to update the memory store by:
  - Removing outdated or incorrect memories
  - Adding new, updated information to replace the removed memories
  - Performing a batch update where old memories are replaced with new, accurate information
  Memory IDs for removal can be obtained from previous memory retrieval results.
  **CRITICAL**: Only add memories based on explicitly stated facts. DO NOT store inferred, assumed, or fabricated information.

memory_ids_to_delete: |
  A list of unique identifiers (memory_ids) of the memories to remove.
  Each ID should be a valid memory_id obtained from previous memory retrieval or addition operations.
  These memories will be removed before adding the new updated memories.

memories_to_add: |
  A list of new memory objects to add after removal.
  These memories typically contain the updated information that replaces the removed memories.

when_to_use: |
  When to retrieve this memory.
  This field is used for vector embedding to improve retrieval accuracy by providing contextual information.

memory_content: |
  The content of the memory to store.
  Should be a clear, concise statement that captures the information to remember.
  Keep it focused on a single piece of information for better retrieval accuracy.
  **Must be strictly accurate and based only on explicitly stated facts - no inference or fabrication.**
