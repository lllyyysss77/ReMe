ReMe turns conversations and resources into **readable, editable, and searchable
file-based long-term memory**. Long-term memory no longer hides inside a black-box
database — it lives as Markdown files in a workspace directory that both users and
agents can read, write, move, and delete.

## ✨ Core Ideas

:gutter: 3

:::{grid-item-card} 📄 Memory as File
Markdown files with frontmatter and wikilinks act as memory nodes that users and
agents can edit directly.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} 🌱 Self-evolving knowledge base
Auto Memory / Resource / Dream progressively distill conversations and resources into
long-term memory, weaving wikilink relationships automatically.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} 🔎 Progressive hybrid search
wikilinks + BM25 + embeddings combine keyword matching, semantic recall, and
relationship expansion.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} 🤝 Agent-friendly integration
`SKILL.md` + CLI integration lets different agents read, write, maintain, and reuse memory.

## 🔄 Memory Pipeline

ReMe's capabilities follow a **capture → consolidate → recall** pipeline:

- **Capture** — [Auto Memory](auto_memory.md) distills conversations into daily cards;
  [Auto Resource](auto_resource.md) interprets resource files.
- **Consolidate** — [Auto Dream](auto_dream.md) extracts and integrates daily notes into
  long-term `digest/`; [Auto Link](auto_link.md) weaves source and related wikilinks.
- **Recall** — [Memory Search](memory_search.md) does hybrid retrieval with link expansion;
  [Proactive](proactive.md) surfaces "what's worth attention today".

The underlying file model and runtime are covered in
[Memory as File](memory_as_file.md) and [Framework](framework.md).
