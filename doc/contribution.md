## Report Bugs and Ask For New Features?
Did you find a bug or have a feature request? Please first check the issue tracker to see if it has already been reported. If not, feel free to open a new issue. Include as much detail as possible:
- A descriptive title
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the problem

## Contribute to Codebase
### Fork and Clone the Repository
To work on an issue or a new feature, start by forking the ReMe repository and then cloning your fork locally.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ReMe.git
cd ReMe
```
### Create a New Branch
Create a new branch for your work. This helps keep proposed changes organized and separate from the `main` branch.
```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name
```
### Making Changes
With your new branch checked out, you can now make your changes to the code. Remember to keep your changes as focused as possible. If you're addressing multiple issues or features, it's better to create separate branches and pull requests for each.

### Commit Your Changes
Once you've made your changes, it's time to commit them. Write clear and concise commit messages that explain your changes.
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "A brief description of the changes"
```

### Submit a Pull Request
When you're ready for feedback, submit a pull request to the ReMe `main` branch. In your pull request description, explain the changes you've made and any other relevant context.
We will review your pull request. This process might involve some discussion, additional changes on your part, or both.
### Code Review
Wait for us to review your pull request. We may suggest some changes or improvements. Keep an eye on your GitHub notifications and be responsive to any feedback.
