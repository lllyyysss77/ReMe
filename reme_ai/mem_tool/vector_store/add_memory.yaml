tool: |
  Add a memory to the vector store for future retrieval.
  Use this tool to store important information that should be remembered, such as:
  - Meta information: "I am very happy"
  - Personal preferences: "John prefers dark mode", "Alice works in PST timezone"
  - Procedural knowledge: "To deploy, run build then push", "Always validate input before processing"

  **CRITICAL**: Only add memories based on explicitly stated facts. DO NOT store inferred, assumed, or fabricated information.

tool_multiple: |
  Add multiple memories to the vector store for future retrieval.
  Use this tool to store multiple pieces of important information in a single operation.
  Each memory can include when_to_use conditions and metadata for better organization and retrieval.
  Examples: storing multiple user preferences, multiple procedural steps, or multiple tool usage tips.

  **CRITICAL**: Only add memories based on explicitly stated facts. DO NOT store inferred, assumed, or fabricated information in any of the memory entries.

when_to_use: |
  Optional condition description for when to retrieve this memory.
  This field is used for vector embedding to improve retrieval accuracy by providing contextual information.

memory_content: |
  The content of the memory to store.
  Should be a clear, concise statement that captures the information to remember.
  Keep it focused on a single piece of information for better retrieval accuracy.
  **Must be strictly accurate and based only on explicitly stated facts - no inference or fabrication.**

memories: |
  A list of memory objects to store.
