    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this user query about analyzing Xiaomi Corporation. First, I need to figure out what the user is asking for. They just said \"Analyze Xiaomi Corporation,\" so it's pretty broad. I should break this down into subtasks.\n\nHmm, analyzing a company usually involves looking at their financials, market position, product lines, maybe recent news or trends. But since I don't have real-time data, I need to use web search to get the latest info. The user might want current data, so web_search is probably the first tool to use.\n\nWait, the user mentioned the current time is 2025-08-29, but that's probably a placeholder. The actual date isn't relevant here. I should focus on getting the latest info about Xiaomi.\n\nFirst, I'll need to search for key aspects of Xiaomi. Let me think of relevant keywords. Maybe \"Xiaomi Corporation financial performance 2024\", \"Xiaomi market share smartphone 2024\", \"Xiaomi recent products 2024\", and \"Xiaomi global expansion strategy\". Using multiple search terms will give a more comprehensive analysis.\n\nWait, the tools say if there are multiple keywords, use each separately. So I should make four separate web_search calls with each keyword. Let me check the function description again. Yes, \"if there are multiple search keywords, please use each keyword separately to call this tool.\"\n\nSo, I'll generate four tool calls with each query. Let me list them:\n\n1. \"Xiaomi Corporation financial performance 2024\"\n2. \"Xiaomi market share smartphone 2024\"\n3. \"Xiaomi recent products 2024\"\n4. \"Xiaomi global expansion strategy\"\n\nEach of these will get different pieces of information. Once I have the search results, I can compile the analysis. But since I can't do that yet, the next step is to make those web searches.\n\nWait, the user might not need all four, but to be thorough, it's better to cover different angles. Let me confirm if these keywords are appropriate. Financial performance, market share, recent products, and expansion strategy are all key areas for a company analysis.\n\nI should make sure the queries are specific to 2024 since the current time in the system is 2025, but the user's query is for analysis, so recent data is needed. Using 2024 in the query makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll proceed to call web_search four times with each of those keywords. Then, once the results come back, I can synthesize the information. But since I can't do that now, the immediate action is to make those four tool calls.\n",
